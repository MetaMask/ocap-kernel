/**
 * Ocap JSON-RPC vat.
 *
 * Serves a line-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 interface on a Unix-domain-socket
 * `IOListener` endowment named `socket`. External processes connect and
 * call `redeemURL(url)` and `send(target, method, args)` — see the
 * package README for the wire protocol.
 *
 * Each connection is served independently, with its own bridge and
 * therefore its own `@@j<n>` name table. Two clients can be connected at
 * once without either being able to name the other's references: the
 * names are closure state of one connection's serve loop, so a forged
 * name simply misses that client's own table. Since those names cross a
 * non-ocap boundary as plain forgeable strings, per-connection scoping is
 * what keeps them from conveying authority they were never granted.
 *
 * The vat's authority is exactly:
 *   - the `ocapURLRedemptionService` endowment (for `redeemURL`),
 *   - whatever references the URLs happen to redeem to,
 *   - and whatever those references introduce as return values.
 *
 * The vat has no other public facet: the socket is the sole interface.
