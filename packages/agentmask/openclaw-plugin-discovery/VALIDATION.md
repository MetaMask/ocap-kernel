# Phase 3 validation — `@openclaw/discovery`

This document walks through end-to-end validation of the discovery
plugin against a running Phase 1 provider (MetaMask extension) and a
Phase 2 matcher (daemon on VPS). Everything lives on a single VPS.

    MetaMask extension with provider vats
        registered against the matcher
```

Two daemons live on the same VPS with different home directories so
they don't clobber each other's state. The matcher uses the default
`~/.ocap`; the consumer uses `~/.ocap-consumer`. Every `ocap`
invocation that wants the consumer daemon passes
`--home ~/.ocap-consumer`; invocations without `--home` hit the
matcher. Matcher and consumer talk to each other over the relay,
same as they would across machines — the shared VPS is purely for
convenience during dev.

## Prerequisites

Three things must be live before starting this validation:

1. **Relay** on the VPS (`yarn ocap relay`; writes
   `~/.libp2p-relay/relay.addr`). Leave it running. The relay
   keeps its bookkeeping (`relay.pid`, `relay.addr`) under
   `~/.libp2p-relay` rather than `~/.ocap` so the same relay
   can serve daemons running under arbitrary `OCAP_HOME` values
   (override with `LIBP2P_RELAY_HOME` if you need a non-default
   location).

   On a VPS where the public IP isn't bound to a local NIC (most
   NAT-backed cloud setups), libp2p won't auto-detect it, so the
   multiaddr written into `relay.addr` would only contain a loopback
   or RFC 1918 address — not reachable from the browser running the
   provider extension. Pass the public address explicitly:

   ```bash
   yarn ocap relay --public-ip 164.92.86.40   # or
   LIBP2P_RELAY_PUBLIC_IP=164.92.86.40 yarn ocap relay
   ```

   The relay then announces that address alongside the auto-detected
   ones, and the relay-addr picker prefers a public-looking IPv4 over
   private/loopback. Set the env var in your shell profile so you
   don't have to remember it on each restart.

2. **Matcher daemon** on the VPS, started via
   `packages/service-matcher/scripts/start-matcher.sh`. The script
   prints the matcher OCAP URL on stdout — copy it. See the
   [Restarting](#restarting) section below for what this command
   actually does and when you should use a different one.
3. **Provider** — MetaMask extension loaded in a browser with the
   matcher URL baked in via `.metamaskrc`
   (`OCAP_MATCHER_URL=…`), webpack rebuilt, extension reloaded. The
   offscreen console should show the three registration-success
   lines; the matcher daemon log should show three
   `[matcher] registered svc:N:` lines.

## Restarting

There are two kinds of restart, and they have very different
consequences for the matcher OCAP URL and for the registered
services. Pick the one that matches your situation.

### Cold start — fresh URL, clean slate

Use this when:

- You're starting from zero on a new machine.
- You have changes to the **matcher vat code** itself, and you don't
  want to bother with vat upgrade (see below). A plain daemon restart
  re-uses the bundle that was registered at `launchSubcluster` time,
  so without an explicit upgrade step the new bundle won't take
  effect.
- You want to throw everything out and start fresh.

```bash
./packages/service-matcher/scripts/start-matcher.sh
```

By default this **purges existing daemon state**, starts the daemon,
initializes remote comms, builds and bundles the matcher vat, and
launches a fresh matcher subcluster. The OCAP URL on stdout will be
new. Each provider must be reconfigured: update `.metamaskrc` with
the new URL, rebuild webpack, reload the extension.

### Pick up new software without losing the URL

Use this when:

- You've changed code **outside the matcher vat bundle** (the relay,
  the kernel CLI, kernel-utils, etc.) and want the matcher to keep
  its existing OCAP URL across the restart.
- You're not changing the matcher vat itself.

```bash
# Stop the matcher daemon, leaving its state intact.
yarn ocap daemon stop

# Pull / rebuild the packages whose code actually changed, e.g.:
yarn workspace @metamask/kernel-utils build
yarn workspace @metamask/kernel-cli build

# Restart, reusing existing state and reconnecting to the relay.
yarn ocap daemon start --local-relay
```

The previously-launched matcher subcluster auto-revives, the matcher
vat re-incarnates, and the durable `publicFacet` kref is restored,
so the OCAP URL is unchanged. The provider does **not** need a new
URL in `.metamaskrc`.

**Caveat — registry is in-memory.** The matcher's service registry
lives in vat closure state, not baggage, so it is empty after
re-incarnation. Each provider needs to call `registerServiceByRef`
again. With the MetaMask extension that means a page reload (no
webpack rebuild needed); registration happens at vat bootstrap. The
matcher daemon log should show fresh `[matcher] registered svc:N:`
lines.

If the matcher vat code itself changed (e.g., today's fix to the
durable-kind calling convention), a plain daemon restart will keep
running the **old** bundle that was originally registered with the
subcluster — re-incarnation alone does not pick up new source.

In principle, swingset's durable-kind machinery supports a vat
**upgrade**: the bundle can be replaced while the durable kref and
all durable-kind instances retain their identity, provided the
shapes of the persisted state are still compatible. (Preserving
identity across an implementation change was a primary motivation
for the exo abstraction in the first place.) The ocap-kernel CLI
does not currently expose an upgrade command for matcher vats, so
in practice cold start is what's available today; this is a likely
future tooling improvement and a strictly better choice than cold
start whenever the persisted state shape is unchanged.

## Stage A — Install the discovery plugin

### A.1. Start the consumer daemon under its own home

The matcher daemon is already running under the default
`~/.ocap`. Start the consumer daemon under `~/.ocap-consumer`,
passing `--local-relay` so daemon start also reads the relay address
out of `~/.libp2p-relay/relay.addr` and runs `initRemoteComms` for you:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ocap-consumer
yarn ocap --home ~/.ocap-consumer daemon start --local-relay
```

Every subsequent `yarn ocap` invocation that wants to talk to the
consumer daemon must include `--home ~/.ocap-consumer`. Without it,
`yarn ocap` defaults to `~/.ocap` and addresses the matcher daemon
instead.

Confirm `getStatus` shows `remoteComms.state === "connected"`:

```bash
yarn ocap --home ~/.ocap-consumer daemon exec getStatus
```

### A.2. Install and enable the plugin

```bash
cd ~/GitRepos/ocap-kernel
openclaw plugins install -l ./packages/agentmask/openclaw-plugin-discovery
openclaw plugins enable discovery
openclaw config set plugins.allow '["discovery"]'
# tools.allow matches tool names, not plugin ids: list each tool the
# plugin exposes. (`openclaw config unset tools.allow` to allow all
# tools is also fine for development.)
openclaw config set tools.allow '["discovery_redeem_matcher","discovery_find_services","service_get_description","service_initiate_contact","service_call","discovery_list_tracked"]'
```

`tools.profile` filters tool visibility _independently_ of `tools.allow`.
The default `coding` profile excludes the discovery tools entirely, so
the LLM sees zero discovery surface even with `tools.allow` correctly
populated. Drop the profile (or pick one that includes plugin tools):

```bash
openclaw config unset tools.profile
openclaw config get tools     # confirm: no "profile" field
```

For this validation, also disable the older metamask plugin if it was
previously installed — its SKILL.md primes the agent toward
wallet-specific behavior and competes with discovery:

```bash
openclaw plugins disable metamask
```

After any of the above changes, restart the openclaw gateway service
(`openclaw config set` prompts for this).

### A.3. Point the plugin at the consumer daemon + matcher URL

Use plugin config so the settings are durable across shells (no env
juggling required):

```bash
openclaw config set 'plugins.entries.discovery.config.ocapHome' "$HOME/.ocap-consumer"
openclaw config set 'plugins.entries.discovery.config.ocapCliPath' '/abs/path/to/ocap-kernel/packages/kernel-cli/dist/app.mjs'
openclaw config set 'plugins.entries.discovery.config.matcherUrl' 'ocap:…'
```

(The path is `plugins.entries.<plugin-id>.config.<key>` — the
`plugins.discovery.<key>` shorthand does not exist in the openclaw
config schema.)

`ocapHome` is what makes the plugin pass `--home ~/.ocap-consumer` on
every spawned `ocap` invocation, so it talks to the consumer daemon
rather than the matcher's default-home daemon.

If `matcherUrl` is supplied, the plugin redeems it eagerly at
register-time. Otherwise the first action is
`discovery_redeem_matcher`.

## Stage B — Tool-level shakedown

Drive this from `openclaw tui` (or via the CLI if you prefer). The
agent's conversation is the script; the listed tool calls are what
the agent should end up making. Paste the matcher OCAP URL in
response to the agent's first question if `matcherUrl` was not
pre-configured.

> **TUI tips, learned the hard way:**
>
> - To clear conversation context inside the running TUI, the slash
>   command is `/reset`. (`/clear` and `/new` are not recognized.)
>   Conversation history persists across `tui` restarts; if you want a
>   genuinely clean state, `/reset` is the easiest path.
> - As a sanity check before continuing, ask the agent (in plain
>   prose, not markdown): without taking any action, list every tool
>   whose name starts with the prefix discovery underscore or service
>   underscore. It should list all six. If it lists fewer or none,
>   revisit `tools.allow` and `tools.profile` in stage A.2.

1. **Connect to matcher.**

   _You:_ "Connect to the service matcher at `<matcher URL>`."

   Expected tool: `discovery_redeem_matcher(url: "ocap:…")`.
   Expected response: `Matcher kref: koN`. (Skip this step if
   `matcherUrl` was pre-configured.)

2. **Find services.**

   _You:_ "Find me a service that can sign a message with my wallet."

   Expected tool: `discovery_find_services(description: "sign a
message with my wallet")`. Expected response: PersonalMessageSigner
   as the top candidate (its description and `signMessage` /
   `getAccounts` method names overlap the query on `sign`, `message`,
   and `wallet`). EchoService and RandomNumberService should _not_
   appear — their descriptions and method names share no tokens with
   this query under the Stage-1 ranker. Each returned candidate
   includes a `contact (public): ocap:…` URL and a `rationale`
   string that names the matched tokens.

3. **Inspect PMS.**

   _You:_ "Show me what that wallet service can do."

   Expected tool: `service_get_description(contact: "<PMS contact URL>")`.
   Expected response: ServiceDescription with `getAccounts` and
   `signMessage` in the remotable spec.

4. **Obtain the PMS service.**

   _You:_ "Connect to it."

   Expected tool: `service_initiate_contact(contact: "<PMS contact URL>")`.
   Expected response: `Obtained service "PersonalMessageSigner" (kref koN)`.
   Expected provider-side: **no** approval popup at this point —
   contact initiation itself is Public.

5. **List accounts.**

   _You:_ "What accounts do I have?"

   Expected tool: `service_call(service: "PersonalMessageSigner", method: "getAccounts")`.
   Expected response: array of 0x-prefixed addresses.

6. **Sign a message.**

   _You:_ "Sign 'hello world' with the first one."

   Expected tool: `service_call(service: "PersonalMessageSigner",
method: "signMessage", args: '["0x…", "hello world", "0x1"]')`.
   Expected provider-side: **approval popup in the browser**. Approve
   it. Expected response: hex signature.

7. **Inventory.**

   _You:_ "What services do you have access to right now?"

   Expected tool: `discovery_list_tracked`. Expected response:
   matcher + one contact + one service (PMS).

## Stage C — Exercise the other two services

Repeat steps 3–5 for `EchoService` and `RandomNumberService`:

- Echo: call `echo("testing 1 2 3")`; expect `"testing 1 2 3"`.
- RandomNumber: call `randomInt(1, 100)`; expect an integer in
  [1, 100]. Call `randomFloat()`; expect a float in [0, 1).

Neither triggers an approval popup — they have no access-controlled
backing.

After these, `discovery_list_tracked` should show 3 contacts and 3
services.

## Stage D — Failure-path sanity

Light-touch. Prompts the agent to hit edge cases.

- Start a fresh `openclaw tui` session (so the plugin state is
  clean) and, **without** running `discovery_redeem_matcher`, say
  "find a service that signs messages." The `discovery_find_services`
  tool should reject with the "No matcher connection. …" guidance
  string from `requireMatcher`.
- Ask the agent to call an unknown capability:
  "call `doThing` on the NotARealService service." The
  `service_call` tool should reject with "Unknown service …
  Available: …".
- (Informational only) `service_initiate_contact` on a Public
  contact should succeed with a service reference; a non-Public
  response would be reported as "non-public response". We don't
  currently have a non-Public contact to test this branch against.

## What "passing" looks like

- Stage B steps 1–7 each complete with the expected tool call and
  response.
- The matcher daemon log shows a new
  `[matcher] findServices(…) → N match(es)` entry for every query;
  `N` depends on whether the query overlaps the registered services'
  descriptions and method names.
- The offscreen console log shows one approval/signing exchange per
  `signMessage` call, with no regressions in the underlying
  `hostApiProxy` path.
- Stage C steps complete without triggering the browser (services
  are self-contained).
- Stage D produces clear, user-legible errors.

## Known limitations going in

- Matcher `findServices` uses a Stage-1 keyword/method-name overlap
  ranker (see `matcher-vat/match.ts`). Queries that don't share any
  alphanumeric token with a service's description or method names
  return no candidates. LLM-backed ranking is the planned Stage 2.
- Matcher URL is stable across plain daemon restarts of the same
  OCAP home (durable `publicFacet` kref + persisted peer ID and
  encryption key), but **re-running `start-matcher.sh` allocates a
  fresh subcluster** and so still yields a new URL. The launcher
  fix to detect and reuse an existing matcher subcluster is the
  Part 2 follow-up in `discovery-plan.md`.
- Matcher registry is **in-memory**; on matcher restart it starts
  empty and providers must re-register. Durable registry + liveness
  is the same `discovery-plan.md` follow-up.
- Matcher registry accumulates duplicates on provider re-registration
  without a restart of the matcher (planned follow-up: dedup/liveness).
- Provider restart without a matcher restart triggers ocap-kernel
  issue #944 (duplicate-seq).
- Only Public access model is wired end-to-end. Permissioned and
  ValidatedClient contact responses are reported verbatim but not
  driven through.
