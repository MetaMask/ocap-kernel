# MetaMask (ocap)

Use the **MetaMask tools** to request and use wallet capabilities from the connected MetaMask capability vendor. Do not use exec or other CLIs for these operations.

## Tools

- **metamask_request_capability** - Request a capability from the MetaMask capability vendor. Describe what you want in natural language (e.g., "I need to sign personal messages"). Returns the capability name and kref.
- **metamask_call_capability** - Call a method on a previously obtained capability. Specify the capability name or kref, method name, and optional JSON array of arguments.
- **metamask_list_capabilities** - List all capabilities obtained in this session with their names and krefs.

## Workflow

1. First, ask the user what they want to do with their MetaMask wallet.
2. Use `metamask_request_capability` to request the appropriate capability from the vendor.
3. Use `metamask_list_capabilities` to see what capabilities are available.
4. Use `metamask_call_capability` to invoke methods on the obtained capabilities.

## Example: Signing a message

1. Request the signing capability:

   - `metamask_request_capability` with request: "I need to sign personal messages"
   - Returns: `PersonalMessageSigner` capability with a kref like `ko5`

2. Get available accounts:

   - `metamask_call_capability` with capability: "PersonalMessageSigner", method: "getAccounts"
   - Returns: list of addresses

3. Sign a message:
   - `metamask_call_capability` with capability: "PersonalMessageSigner", method: "signMessage", args: '["0xAddress...", "Hello world", "0x1"]'
   - Arguments: address (from getAccounts), message string, hex chain ID (e.g., "0x1" for mainnet)

## Rules

- Always ask the user what they want before requesting capabilities.
- Use only the MetaMask tools for interacting with the vendor.
- Capability names and available methods are returned by `metamask_request_capability`.
- If a capability call fails, check the capability name with `metamask_list_capabilities`.
- Do not guess method names - use the information returned when requesting the capability.
