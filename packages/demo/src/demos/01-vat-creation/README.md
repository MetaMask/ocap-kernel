# Vat Creation

Each vat is initialized from an entrypoint bundle. The bundle can be produced by calling `yarn ocap bundle <path-to-script>` on a file meeting the following criteria.

1. The file is a `.js` file.
1. The file exports a function called `buildRootObject`.
1. The `buildRootObject` function returns a _remotable_ objectâ€”the result of calling `@endo`'s `Far` function on a object with only method properties.

## Demo

From this directory, run the following command.

```sh
yarn ocap bundle my-vat.js
```

It will produce the file `./my-vat.bundle`. Then, use the demo runner to run the bundle.

```
yarn demo 01 <bundle-path> <params-path> <method-name>
```

This will create a vat from the bundle file at `<bundle-path>`, passing the parameters from the json file at `<params-path>`, and calling the method `<method-name>` on the resulting root object.

```sh
yarn demo 01 my-vat.bundle { "name": "Alice" } hello

> Demo completed: Hello, Alice!
```

```sh
yarn demo 01 my-vat.bundle { "name": "Alice" } goodbye

> Demo completed: Goodbye, Alice!
```

```sh
yarn demo 01 my-vat.bundle my-vat-params.json aloha

> Demo failed: target has no method "aloha", has ["__getMethodNames__","goodbye","hello"]
```
