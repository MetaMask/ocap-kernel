# `@ocap/extension`

For running Ocap Kernel experiments in an extension environment.

## Getting started

`yarn build` creates a production build of the extension, while `yarn start` runs a dev server with hot reloading.

To use the extension, load the `dist` directory as an unpacked extension in your
browser of choice. You may have to manually reload the extension on changes, even
with the dev server running.
