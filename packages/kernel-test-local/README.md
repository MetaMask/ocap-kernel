# `@ocap/kernel-test-local`

Local-only E2E tests that use a locally hosted language model.

## Overview

This package contains E2E tests that require a running Ollama instance with specific models installed. These tests are **not run in CI** and are intended for local development and validation only. Because language model outputs are inherently non-deterministic, these tests may occasionally fail even when the implementation is correct.

## Running Tests
