 * `direction` is enforced here rather than on the listener, since it is a
 * property of the data flow rather than of the point of contact.
 *
 * Lifetime: the holder must `close()` a connection when finished with it.
 * A peer disconnecting ends the underlying transport and makes `read()`
 * report EOF, but does *not* by itself stop the kernel hosting this
 * object, because the holder still has a live reference to it. Releasing
 * on EOF instead would be worse than leaking: the vat's c-list still names
 * the kref, so a subsequent call on the dropped reference would route to
 * `invokeKernelService` and find nothing registered, failing the caller
 * with `ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE` for a connection it never released. Until a
 * vat dropping the reference is itself observable (see #1006), unreleased
 * connections are
 * bounded by their listener's lifetime: `close()` on the listener
 * releases whatever it handed out, and `IOManager` releases the rest when
 * the subcluster goes away.
 *
 * @param name - The scoped connection name, used as the exo's interface
 * name (e.g. `io:s1:repl:c3`).
 * @param channel - The channel for this connection.
 * @param config - The IO configuration for the owning listener.
 * @param onClose - Invoked after the channel closes, so the host can stop
 * hosting this connection.
 * @returns A remotable with `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`.
