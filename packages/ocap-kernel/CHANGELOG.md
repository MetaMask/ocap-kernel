## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `IOListener`, an endpoint peers connect to that yields one `IOChannel` per connection via `accept()`, replacing the previous one-client-at-a-time channel. Each accepted connection is a distinct object, so holding one conveys no way to reach another, and `direction` is enforced per connection. `accept()` resolves `null` once the listener is closed so an accept loop can terminate rather than hang ([#1007](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1007))
- Anonymous kernel-hosted objects are recorded persistently and swept at kernel init, so one abandoned by a previous incarnation is not left pinned forever, accumulating with every restart — an anonymous object has no name to be re-registered under on boot, unlike a named service. The sweep unpins but cannot delete an object a vat import or queued message still references, so it does not by itself make a delivery to a survivor safe; the `invokeKernelService` fix below is what does ([#1007](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1007))
- Add `KernelServiceManager.registerAnonymousKernelObject()` / `releaseAnonymousKernelObject()`, which make a kernel-hosted object routable by kref without entering it in the service-name index, so it has no name in the global service namespace and cannot be requested via a cluster config's `services` list. Used to host accepted IO connections, whose authority comes from holding the reference ([#1007](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1007))
- Report run loop health in `KernelStatus.runLoop` (`{ state: 'idle' | 'running' }` or `{ state: 'failed', error, detail }`), exporting `RunLoopStatus`, `RunLoopStatusStruct`, and `OnRunLoopFailure` ([#1005](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1005))
  - `idle` means never started; a loop parked on an empty queue reports `running`
  - `error` is the failure's message and `detail` its whole cause chain, because only strings cross the wire: when a crank dies and its rollback then fails, the message names the rollback and only the chain names what killed the kernel
  - **BREAKING:** `runLoop` is required, so `KernelStatus` gains a mandatory property and a `getStatus` reply from a kernel built before this field fails result validation outright. It cannot be made optional: `exactOptional` would leave the type and the validator disagreeing inside a `type()`, and `optional` widens the property to `| undefined`, which an RPC result may not be
- Add `onRunLoopFailure` to `Kernel.make` options, called with the error that killed the run loop so an embedder that outlives the kernel can exit or restart ([#1005](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1005))
- Launch all vats in a subcluster concurrently during `launchSubcluster`, reducing startup latency from serial to parallel; failed peer vats receive a rejected kernel promise observable via `E(roots.peer).method()` pipelining ([#983](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/983))
- Add `fetch`, `Request`, `Headers`, and `Response` to available vat endowments ([#942](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/942))
  - Add `VatConfig.network: { allowedHosts: string[] }`; requesting `'fetch'` without it rejects `initVat`
- Integrate Snaps attenuated endowment factories into vat globals ([#937](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/937))
  - Add `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `crypto`, `SubtleCrypto`, and `Math` (crypto-backed `Math.random`) to the default vat endowments
  - **BREAKING:** `setTimeout` now enforces a 10 ms minimum delay (upstream Snaps `MINIMUM_TIMEOUT`); shorter delays are silently coerced to 10 ms
  - **BREAKING:** `Date.now()` is attenuated — each read adds up to 1 ms of random jitter, clamped monotonic non-decreasing; precise sub-millisecond timing no longer leaks through
  - **BREAKING:** `clearTimeout`/`clearInterval` only clear handles created by the same vat's `setTimeout`/`setInterval`; passing a host-format handle is a no-op
  - **BREAKING:** replace exported `DEFAULT_ALLOWED_GLOBALS` constant with `createDefaultEndowments()` factory and `VatEndowments` type; `VatSupervisor` now accepts `makeAllowedGlobals` in place of `allowedGlobals`
- Make vat global allowlist configurable and expand available endowments ([#933](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/933))
  - Export `DEFAULT_ALLOWED_GLOBALS` with `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `atob`, `btoa`, `AbortController`, and `AbortSignal` in addition to the existing globals
  - Accept optional `allowedGlobals` on `VatSupervisor` for custom allowlists
  - Log a warning when a vat requests an unknown global
- Export `OcapURLIssuerService` and `OcapURLRedemptionService` types so vats can type the corresponding kernel-service endowments ([#952](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/952))
- Reference-marker sigil (`@@NAME`) at the `queueMessage` RPC boundary lets JSON-RPC callers name a live kernel object as a call argument ([#984](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/984))

  - Anywhere in the args tree, a string of the form `@@NAME` (NAME is one or more alphanumeric characters, currently a well-formed kref) is expanded to a `kslot` standin so `kser` encodes it as a real CapData slot in the dispatched message
  - Purely an RPC-boundary concern: internal callers of `Kernel.queueMessage` are unaffected
  - Caveat: a legitimate string argument that begins with `@@` followed by alphanumerics will be misinterpreted as a marker; wrap such literals inside an object

- Reference-count auditing: `auditRefCounts`, `recomputeRefCounts`, `formatRefCountViolations`, `assertRefCountsIfAuditing`, and `setRefCountAuditing` on the kernel store, plus a `Kernel.make` option `auditRefCounts` that verifies every kref's counts against the references the kernel actually holds at the end of each crank ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
  - Reports drift in both directions: counts too low (a live capability can be collected) and counts too high with no holder (an orphaned count). It compares counts against the holders it finds, so a holder that should have been torn down but wasn't justifies its own count and is not detectable this way
  - Only references visible in the kernel's own state are checkable, so a holder that keeps a kref outside them has to take a pin to be counted at all
  - `recomputeRefCounts` is a repair tool for a drifted store, offered to embedders and never run automatically: opening an existing store does not migrate it
  - Exports the `RefCountViolation` type, a union over `kind: 'mismatch' | 'dangling'`
- Add `setReachableFlag` to the kernel store, the counterpart to `clearReachableFlag` ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
- Add `getOcapURLObjects` and `retainForOcapURL` to the kernel store, and `VatManager.releaseVatRootPin` ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
- Add `orphanKernelObject` to the kernel store, which drops an object's owner mapping and hands it to the collector ([#1022](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1022))

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `Kernel.make`'s `ioChannelFactory` option is now `ioListenerFactory`, and the exported `IOChannelFactory` type is replaced by `IOListener` and `IOListenerFactory`. A cluster config's `io` entries now create listeners; vats call `accept()` to obtain a channel instead of reading and writing the endowment directly ([#1007](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1007))
- Attribute a failed subcluster vat launch to the specific vat by kernel id and `ClusterConfig` name (e.g. `Failed to launch vat v3 (bob)`), preserving the original error as the `cause` ([#975](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/975))
- **BREAKING:** Remove `VatConfig.platformConfig.fetch` — migrate to `globals: ['fetch', ...]` + `network.allowedHosts` ([#942](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/942))
- **BREAKING:** `MakeAllowedGlobals` now takes a `{ logger }` options bag ([#942](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/942))
- **BREAKING:** Type `VatConfig.globals` and `Kernel.make`'s `allowedGlobalNames` as `AllowedGlobalName[]` (a literal union) instead of `string[]`; unknown names are now rejected at the `initVat` RPC boundary ([#941](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/941))
  - Exports: `AllowedGlobalName`, `AllowedGlobalNameStruct`, `MakeAllowedGlobals`, `VatEndowmentsStruct`
- Bound relay hints in OCAP URLs to a maximum of 3 and cap the relay pool at 20 entries with eviction of oldest non-bootstrap relays ([#929](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/929))

### Fixed

- A message delivered to a kernel-owned kref with no registered service now rejects the caller with `ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE` instead of throwing, which escaped the crank and killed the run loop — turning one unreachable reference into a dead kernel ([#1007](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1007))
  - Reachable without any kernel bug: an anonymous kernel object hosts something that cannot outlive the process, such as an accepted socket connection, so a vat holding one across a restart or a message to one still queued from the previous incarnation lands here. That surviving reference is exactly what stops the init sweep deleting the object, so its `kernel` owner survives with it
  - Matches what `KernelRouter` already does for a delivery whose endpoint has vanished. A message sent with no result promise has nobody to report to, so it is logged instead
- The kernel run queue no longer strands messages, going quiet with no error, no log, and no crash. `runQueueLengthCache` uses a negative value to mean "unknown, re-read from the database", but `enqueueRun`/`dequeueRun` adjusted it arithmetically without materializing it first — so an enqueue while the cache held `-1` produced `0` for a queue that actually held an item, and because `0` is not negative it was never re-read again. The run loop then saw an empty queue, went to sleep, and stranded everything behind it. Two paths reach that `-1`: kernel startup, and `rollbackCrank`, which invalidates the cache because a rollback may have restored dequeued items. The rollback path is the more likely of the two in practice, since a rollback is normally followed immediately by enqueueing an error or termination message. The run loop is also now woken by any non-empty queue rather than only by the empty-to-one transition, so a drifted count cannot silently lose the wakeup either ([#1007](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1007))
- Stop reporting a healthy kernel after the run loop dies ([#1005](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1005))
  - The error was logged and swallowed, so `getStatus` kept returning its healthy-looking record while nothing on the run queue was processed and every `queueMessage` hung forever. Results in flight now reject with the killing error as their `cause`, later calls reject immediately, and `getStatus` answers without waiting on a crank that may never end
- Roll back the crank the run loop died in instead of committing it, so a restart resumes from a consistent boundary ([#1005](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1005))
  - Because the killing item is no longer consumed, a restart re-dequeues it; an item that reliably kills a crank needs `clearState`/`reset` rather than a restart
  - Store state only — a crank that had already flushed its buffer settled JS-side subscriptions irreversibly
- Keep a crank's store work inside one transaction ([#1021](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1021))
  - A crank now takes two savepoints, `crank` and `delivery`, and rolls back only `delivery`. Rolling back the outermost one ends the transaction, so terminating the vat and collecting garbage — which follow the rollback and must survive it — were autocommitting a statement at a time
  - Buffered vat outputs are flushed after that work rather than before it, so a later failure can no longer roll the crank back underneath an answer already given. Termination still settles the dying vat's own promises immediately
- A failing `endCrank` no longer replaces the error that killed the run loop; it is reported with that error as its `cause`, as the rollback path already did ([#1021](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1021))
  - Now that the delivery rollback spares the `crank` savepoint, `endCrank`'s release is a real RELEASE and COMMIT on the dying path where it used to be a no-op — and the run loop called it from a bare `finally`
- A failing savepoint rollback in `RemoteHandle.handleRemoteMessage` and `RemoteManager`'s incarnation change is logged rather than thrown, so the failure it was cleaning up after is what reaches the caller ([#1021](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1021))
  - Both release inside the `try` and roll back in the `catch`, so once a failed RELEASE discarded the whole savepoint stack, the rollback reported a savepoint that no longer existed in place of the real error. The rollback is still attempted: a release that failed for a reason of its own may well have left the savepoint standing
- Forget a crank's savepoints when the store call that ends them fails, in both `rollbackCrank` and `endCrank` ([#1021](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1021))
  - A failed rollback or release discards the whole transaction, savepoints included. Keeping them listed had `endCrank` throw `No such savepoint: t0` from the run loop's `finally`, over whatever really killed the kernel
- `rollbackCrank` now also reverts the two pieces of state a database rollback cannot reach, whether or not the rollback itself succeeded: every cached stored value is re-read, and the crank's accumulated garbage-collection candidates are discarded ([#1021](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1021))
  - A cached stored value answers reads from a closure and only writes through to the database, so reverting the database left it holding the abandoned crank's value and the next write persisted that. `processGCActionSet` takes an action out of the set before delivering it, so an aborted delivery lost the action outright instead of retrying it
  - `maybeFreeKrefs` lives in RAM, so nothing reverted it either. Its entries are collection candidates only because of decrements the rollback undid, and a later `collectGarbage` threw outright on a promise the rollback had deleted, killing the run loop
  - A failed rollback discards the whole transaction, moving the database back at least as far as a successful rollback would have — so reverting only on success left exactly the state that is least able to tolerate it
- Refuse inbound remote deliveries once the run loop is dead, rolling back without acknowledging them, so the peer retries and gives up instead of waiting on a kernel that will never deliver ([#1005](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1005))
  - Covers `bringOutYourDead` as well as `message` and `notify`: a reap is queue work too, consumed only by the run loop. The remaining GC arms need no guard, since they only touch refcounts
- Refuse `launchSubcluster` once the run loop is dead ([#1005](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1005))
  - The bootstrap message can't be queued either way, but the launch reached that point having already spawned a vat worker per entry in the config, none of which its cleanup path tears down
- Keep crank bookkeeping consistent when the database misbehaves: `endCrank` settles its `waitForCrank` waiters even if releasing savepoints throws (previously stranding `getStatus`, `stop`, `reset`, `clearStorage`, and the `VatManager`/`SubclusterManager` waiters), `rollbackCrank` forgets its savepoint even if the rollback throws (which otherwise had `endCrank` commit the crank being abandoned), and `createCrankSavepoint` records a name only once the database created it ([#1005](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1005))
- Report the database error when an aborted crank cannot be rolled back, instead of a spurious "no such savepoint" ([#1005](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1005))
  - The abort path recorded the rollback only after it succeeded, so a throwing rollback had the run loop try again against the savepoint `rollbackCrank` had already discarded. The second attempt's "no such savepoint" then became the reported cause of death — and since only `error.message` crosses the wire, the real failure reached neither `getStatus` nor the daemon log
- Reject the run loop's promise with the same `Error` its status reports, rather than re-throwing a non-`Error` for the embedder to normalize a second time ([#1005](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1005))
- **BREAKING:** Make c-list reference accounting symmetric: creating an import c-list entry now takes a reference, as tearing one down has always released one ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
  - `initKernelObject` now births objects at `(0, 0)` instead of `(1, 1)`. The old constant made the arithmetic come out right for exactly one importer, masking the missing increment; with two importers a live capability could be dropped and retired out from under a holder
  - Removes the owner-side baseline decrements in `cleanupTerminatedVat` and `forgetEndpointImports`, which double-claimed the same unit an importer's drop also spent — the source of `"koNN" underflow -1,0` escaping mid-cleanup and leaving a vat half-cleaned
  - `translateRefKtoE` now re-establishes reachability, so a vat handed an object it previously dropped is counted as holding it live again
  - Renames `krefsToExistingErefs` to `krefsToErefs`, which now throws on an unmapped kref instead of silently dropping it
- Pin vat root objects for the lifetime of their vat, and release the pin on termination ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
  - A root is addressable while its vat lives whether or not anyone imports it; the old `(1, 1)` birth baseline was standing in for this
- Garbage-collection action delivery now moves the kernel's own c-list: `dropExports` clears the owner's reachable flag and `retireExports`/`retireImports` tear the entry down ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
  - Previously the owner's flag never cleared, so the same action could be re-derived, and retired entries outlived the objects they named
- Orphan a kernel object when its owner stops naming it (a delivered `retireExport`, or a `retireExports`/`abandonExports` syscall), so its `owner` and `refCount` records no longer outlive the c-list entry they were reachable through ([#1022](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1022))
  - They leaked, and the next collection to visit such a kref read a c-list entry that was no longer there and killed the run loop. Reproduces on `main`, so it predates this stack
- Reject a `retireExports`/`abandonExports` syscall for an object the calling endpoint does not own, instead of letting it erase another endpoint's claim to an object it is still exporting ([#1022](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1022))
  - Nothing upstream of `performExportCleanup` checked that the vref it was handed is even an export, and the audit could not see the damage, because an export entry carries no count
- Garbage-collection action delivery releases the kernel's side even when the endpoint has vanished, and rolls back rather than committing a release the endpoint was never told about ([#1022](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1022))
  - It releases only where the endpoint is genuinely gone: a terminated vat, whose cleanup tears the whole c-list down anyway, or a remote, which reconciles on its next incarnation. A vat that is absent yet not terminated is one `restartVat` has taken out of the kernel's reach while keeping its c-list, so the crank fails there instead of committing a release the returning incarnation would disagree with
- A failed garbage-collection delivery to a remote is logged and survived rather than escaping the crank and stopping the run loop ([#1022](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1022))
- Tear down and mark for cleanup a vat whose worker launched but whose kernel-side registration then failed ([#1022](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1022))
- Charge a delivered message's target reference against the run-queue item's own target rather than the routed target, so a message routed through a resolved promise no longer decrements an object nobody charged while leaking the promise ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
- Release a queued notification's reference before the paths that decide there is nothing to deliver, and stop decrementing references on promises retired alongside it that nobody had taken ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
- Transfer, rather than duplicate, the references a message carries when it is queued on an unresolved promise and later re-enqueued on resolution ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
- Fix the stale `cle.`/`clk.` key prefixes in `getPromisesByDecider` and `deleteEndpoint`, which no longer matched the `${endpointId}.c.` c-list layout ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
  - `getPromisesByDecider` matched nothing, so promises a terminating vat or restarting peer was deciding were never rejected
- Issuing an ocap URL now retains its target, so the URL stays redeemable ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
  - A URL carries its kref inside an encrypted bearer token and nothing else, so the kernel cannot see from its own state that a holder exists. Under the old `(1, 1)` birth baseline nothing exported was ever collectable and this went unnoticed; at `(0, 0)` the target is collected as soon as the message that carried it to the issuer is delivered, and the URL names a dead capability
  - One pin per URL, and no release: the token is persistent and unexpiring, so `revoke` is the way to kill the capability
  - Issuing a URL for a kref the kernel has already deleted is now refused rather than resurrecting its counts
  - The retention is taken before the token is minted, since minting awaits and a collection crank can run in that window, and released again if minting fails. It is a retention per issuance rather than per kref because that window lets issuances for the same target overlap: sharing one would let a failed mint release the retention a URL minted alongside it depends on
- Refuse to import a kref the kernel has deleted into an endpoint's c-list ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))
  - `getObjectRefCount` reads a missing entry as `(0, 0)`, so the new entry's own increment wrote it back and resurrected a live-looking object with no owner — deliverable to by nobody, and endorsed by the audit, since the entry is a legitimate holder for exactly the count it finds
- Release a vat's root pin when a subcluster is deleted without its vats having run ([#1020](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/1020))

  - `deleteSubcluster` bypasses `stopVat`, so nothing released the pin `launchVat` took in the incarnation that did run them, leaving the root's count permanently above zero and `pinnedObjects` naming a vat that no longer exists

- Deserialize CapData rejections in `Kernel.queueMessage` so vat errors surface as plain `Error` objects to all callers ([#928](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/928))
- Detect peer restart across receiver state loss so the receiving kernel no longer silently drops a restarted peer's `seq=1` messages ([#948](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/948))
  - Persist the peer's last-observed incarnation and compare it on every successful handshake; on a detected restart, clear the peer's c-list contributions and reject the promises it was deciding before the new incarnation reuses any erefs
- Accept liveslots-allocated durable, virtual, and faceted vrefs (e.g. `o+d10/1`, `o+v3/4:0`) in `isVRef` / `insistERef` / `EndpointMessageStruct` validation ([#949](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/949))
  - Previously the regex only matched plain `[op][+-]N`, so any vat using `defineDurableKind` failed outgoing-send validation and persisted-slot reads
- Regenerate `incarnationId` when `resetStorage=true` clears the rest of kernel state, completing the #948 peer-restart detection on browser/extension kernel reloads ([#950](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/950))
  - The previous except-list preserved `incarnationId` across `resetStorage` wipes, so a restarted sender signalled the same incarnation it had before the wipe and the matching receiver's handshake decided "no restart" — leaving stale `highestReceivedSeq` in place and silently dropping the sender's fresh `seq=1` messages
- Register a new vat with its subcluster before awaiting `runVat`, so a garbage-collection pass during bundle load cannot delete the still-empty subcluster out from under the in-progress vat creation ([#952](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/952))
- Use length-prefixed framing for remote messages so payloads larger than the underlying transport's per-frame cutoff (e.g. `@libp2p/webrtc`'s 16 KB datachannel limit) are reassembled correctly on the receiver ([#957](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/957))
  - Replace `byteStream` with `lpStream` on every remote channel; the byte-oriented stream did not preserve `write()` boundaries, so any message the transport split into multiple frames was parsed from the first frame only, silently dropped without acknowledgement, and the sender retried until giving up after `MAX_RETRIES`
  - Surface receiver-side framing-cap violations (`InvalidDataLengthError`, `InvalidDataLengthLengthError`) as `ResourceLimitError` with `limitType: 'messageSize'` so size errors look the same whether they tripped on the sender's `validateMessageSize` or the receiver's framing decoder
- Restore IO channels for persisted subclusters at kernel init so re-incarnated vats find their IOService references live ([#963](https://github.com/MetaMask/ocap-kernel/pull/963))
  - `SubclusterManager.restorePersistedIOChannels()` walks every persisted subcluster, finds those whose config declares `io`, and re-creates the channels via `IOManager` before `initializeAllVats` runs
  - Without this, any vat that opened an IO channel via `launchSubcluster` lost its channel across `daemon stop` / `daemon start` and silently held a dead IOService reference
