/**
 * Conversation manager that the bridge interposes between the matcher
 * vat and the LLM gateway.
 *
 * The bridge owns the conversation history. Service registrations are
 * appended to a *persistent* history (each as a user/assistant pair).
 * Queries are non-accumulating: each query temporarily appends one
 * user turn to a snapshot of the persistent history, gets a reply,
 * parses the reply as JSON, and discards both before the next query.
 * That way query traffic doesn't pollute the matcher's view of the
 * registry, and persistent-history growth is bounded by the
 * registration rate rather than the consumer-query rate.

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a service-discovery matcher. You maintain a registry of services and rank candidates against natural-language queries.

You will receive "Register service" messages, each describing a single service: an opaque ID, a one-sentence description, and a list of method names with optional descriptions. Acknowledge each registration with a short confirmation; you do not need to elaborate.

You will then receive "Query" messages asking which registered services match a given user intent. For each query, reply with a JSON array AND NOTHING ELSE — no prose, no commentary, no markdown code fences. Each array element must be an object of the form {"id":"<service id>","rationale":"<one-sentence reason>"}. Order best-first. If no service matches, reply []. Never invent IDs you were not told about.`;
