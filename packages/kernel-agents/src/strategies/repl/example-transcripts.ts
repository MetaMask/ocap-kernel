He used complete cores from other alerce trees and information on how environmental factors and random variation affect tree growth to calibrate a model that simulated a range of possible ages the tree had reached by the beginning of the period covered by the partial core, along with a probability for each age. The method yielded an overall age estimate of 5484 years old, with an 80% chance that the tree has lived for more than 5000 years.',
