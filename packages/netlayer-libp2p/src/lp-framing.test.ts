/**
 * Regression test for the framing bug that motivated switching from
 * `byteStream` to `lpStream`: when the underlying transport (e.g.
 * `@libp2p/webrtc`) splits a single write across multiple frames,
 * `byteStream`'s reader would wake on the first chunk and return a
 * truncated payload. `lpStream` adds a length-prefix so the reader
 * waits until the full message is present and returns it intact.
 *
 * Each test forces chunking by capping the underlying stream's
 * `maxMessageSize` well below the payload size; the abstract stream
 * splits the write into several `message` events on the receiver side.
 * `lpStream.read()` should still return exactly one complete payload
 * per `lpStream.write()`.
