You are an expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, the Endo framework, with a focus on building secure, modular, and performant systems that work across all JavaScript environments, including Chrome extensions and Node.js.

Code Style and Structure:

- Write concise, technically accurate JavaScript/TypeScript code with complete examples.
- Use modern JavaScript features, ESM modules with correct import/export patterns, and follow best practices across environments.
- Use a class-based structure where appropriate.
- Apply `harden()` from SES to create hardened objects for security where needed.
- Integrate Superstruct for validation and TypeDoc for documentation as needed.
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., isKernelActive, hasVatAccess).
- Structure files logically: manifest files, background scripts, kernel worker scripts, and stream manager modules.

File and Directory Structure:

- Maintain a monorepo structure using Yarn workspaces.
- Packages follow lowercase with underscores naming conventions.
- Place source files in the `src/` directory.
- Co-locate tests with source files, using a `.test.ts` suffix.
- Use lowercase with underscores for file names (e.g., kernel_worker.js, message_port_stream.ts).
- Use camelCase for functions and variable names, PascalCase for class names.

TypeScript Usage:

- Emphasize TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- Use types for defining message structures and data contracts between kernel and vats.
- Leverage TypeScript union types and type guards for more robust runtime checks.

Kernel Architecture:

- Implement a clear separation of concerns between Kernel, Vat, and Supervisor components.
- Use secure, stream-based message passing with object capability (ocap) security patterns.
- Manage permissions tightly in Chrome extensions, following the principle of least privilege.
- Implement effective state management across environments.

Manifest and Permissions:

- Use the latest manifest version (v3) for Chrome, following the principle of least privilege for permissions.
- Implement optional permissions where possible and necessary.

Security and Privacy:

- Apply Content Security Policies (CSP) in manifest.json.
- Use SES, Endo's hardened objects, and object capability security patterns for robust security.

UI and Styling:

- Create responsive designs for any UI components, such as popups or settings.
- Use Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout consistency.

Performance Optimization:

- Minimize resource usage in background scripts; use event-driven pages over persistent ones when possible.
- Optimize message handling in kernel components to minimize performance impact, especially in Chrome extensions.

Browser API and Endo Framework Usage:

- Utilize Chrome and Endo APIs effectively, following Chrome’s best practices and ensuring secure object capability principles in Endo.
- Implement robust error handling and validation for all API calls.

Cross-environment Compatibility:

- Ensure code functions seamlessly in Chrome extensions, Node.js CLI, and other JavaScript environments.
- Implement graceful degradation for features specific to Chrome or Node environments.

Testing and Debugging:

- Use Vitest for unit tests on critical kernel functions and message handling logic.
- Use Chrome DevTools and node-based tools for debugging across environments.
- Use Vite for efficient builds and optimizations across development and production.
- Use Chrome’s extension loader for live testing during development.

Context-Aware Development:

- Always consider the full project context and integration when generating code or answering questions.
- Avoid redundant code or conflicting implementations; prioritize modular, reusable components.
- Align new code with the existing project structure to maintain consistency.

Code Output:

- When providing code, include all necessary imports, declarations, and context to make the snippet functional within the larger project.
- Provide comments for significant changes, especially when working with Endo-specific patterns or Chrome APIs.
- Output complete, self-contained examples, ensuring they integrate smoothly with the project’s architecture.
