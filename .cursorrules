Code style and structure:

- Write concise, accurate JavaScript/TypeScript with modern ES Module syntax.
- Always use TypeScript unless otherwise specified.
- Use a class-based structure where applicable.
- Use `harden()` from `@endo/ses` for object security.
- Use object capability (ocap) design patterns.
- Use `@metamask/superstruct` for validation.
- Use TypeDoc for documentation.
- Use the following naming conventions:
  - camelCase for functions and variables.
  - PascalCase for classes, types, interfaces, and enums.
  - kebab-case for package and file names (`@ocap/test-utils`, `kernel-worker.js`, `vat.js`).
  - Nouns for variable names (e.g. `isKernelActive`, `hasVatAccess`, `unresolvedMessages`)
  - Verbs for function names (e.g. `startVat`, `stopKernel`)
- Use explicit return types for all functions.

Testing and debugging:

- Use `vitest` for testing.
- Prefer `toStrictEqual()` for deep object comparisons in tests.
- Use `it.each()` for parameterized tests.
- Use descriptive test blocks with proper nesting.
- Mock functions with `vi.fn()` and explicit return types.
- Aim for high test coverage, including unit and integration tests.
- Mock external dependencies using vitest's `vi.mock()`.

TypeScript usage:

- Use types for defining message structures and data contracts. Do not use `interface` declarations.
- Leverage union types and type guards for robust runtime checks.
- Use `Readonly<T>` for immutable data structures.
- Follow strict mode settings for TypeScript.
- Never use the `any` type.
- Prefer `#` private fields over `private` class fields.

File and directory structure:

- Maintain a monorepo structure using Yarn workspaces.
- Place package source files under `<package-root>/src/`.
- Co-locate a package's unit tests with their covered source files in the `<package-root>/src/` directory (e.g. `ocap-kernel/src/kernel-worker.ts` should be tested in `ocap-kernel/src/kernel-worker.test.ts`).
- Test utilities used by a single package should be separated into that package's `<package-root>/test/` directory.
  - If the utility is small, it can be in-lined in the test file.
- Test utilities used by multiple packages should be relocated into the dedicated `test-utils` package.

Kernel architecture:

- Ensure clear separation of concerns between Kernel, Vat, and Supervisor components.
- Use streams from the `streams` package for message passing / IPC.

Web extensions:

- Use the latest manifest version (v3) for Chrome.
- Minimize permissions in `manifest.json`, using optional permissions where feasible.
- Apply Content Security Policies (CSP) in `manifest.json`.

UI and styling:

- Create responsive designs for UI components like popups or settings.
- Use Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout consistency.
- Use plain CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for UI components. Do not use React or other frameworks.

Cross-environment compatibility:

- Libraries should be platform-agnostic and run in any environment unless otherwise specified.
- Packages like `extension` (browser) and `cli` (Node.js) are platform-specific.
- Implement graceful degradation for environment-specific features.

Type safety:

- Prefer `@metamask/superstruct` when defining object types.
- Use runtime type guards, not type assertions, when type narrowing is required.
- Define object types for all data structures.
- Avoid redundant type declarations.

Error handling:

- Use structured error classes with inheritance, error codes, and messages.
- Implement error marshaling and unmarshaling.
- Use type guards for error checking.

Documentation:

- Use JSDoc and TypeDoc for public APIs.
- Include examples and document error cases.

Changelog management:

- Follow Keep a Changelog v1.0.0 format (https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for all CHANGELOG.md files.
- For release PRs, categorize "### Uncategorized" entries into:
  - "### Added" for new features and functionality (entries starting with "feat:")
  - "### Changed" for changes to existing functionality (entries starting with "chore:" or breaking changes)
  - "### Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features
  - "### Removed" for now removed features
  - "### Fixed" for bug fixes and corrections (entries starting with "fix:" or "refactor:")
  - "### Security" in case of vulnerabilities
- Each changelog should describe changes specific to that package
- Skip dependency updates unless they cause downstream changes; if so, describe the actual changes instead
- Remove prefixes like "feat:", "chore:", "fix:", "refactor:" from changelog entries
- Use clean, descriptive language without technical prefixes
- When running in agent mode, fetch GitHub PR descriptions to better understand:
  - The actual impact of each change on the specific package
  - Whether dependency updates introduce breaking changes or new functionality
  - More context for writing accurate, descriptive changelog entries
- Use PR descriptions to determine if changes should be:
  - Skipped entirely (pure dependency bumps with no package impact)
  - Rewritten to focus on user-facing changes rather than implementation details
  - Moved to different categories based on actual impact
- Example transformations:
  - "feat(ocap-kernel): Add kernel command 'revoke'" → "Add kernel command 'revoke'"
  - "chore: bump endo dependencies" → Remove (unless it causes package-specific changes)
  - "fix: make Revoke button refresh object registry" → "Make Revoke button refresh object registry"

Context-aware development:

- Align new code with existing project structure for consistency.
- Prioritize modular, reusable components.

Code output:

- Provide complete, self-contained examples.
- Include necessary imports and context for code snippets.
- Document significant changes, especially for Endo-specific patterns or Chrome APIs.
