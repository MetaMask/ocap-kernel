  # These are peer dependencies of various modules we actually do

  # though we don't actually depend on them) in order to work around a
  # bug in the bundler wherein it gets confused by absent peer
  # dependencies.  These should be removed (both from here and from
  # the declared dependencies in package.json) once KK fixes the
  # bundler, which should be RSN.
